######################
# Requirement 

	- You must have an HP based server (tested on DL, ML, BL or GL 360, 380, 560, 580...)
	- Install the command 'hpacucli' provided on the HP website
	- 'sudo' installed
	- A XYmon/Hobbit Client running ;)
		  


######################
# Installation 

	1/ Put the 'hphwraid.sh' script in your XYmon/Hobbit extention client directory '${BBHOME}/ext/'

	2/ Edit your client configutation file 'etc/clientlaunch.cfg' and add :
 	 
	    [hpraid]
               ENVFILE $HOBBITCLIENTHOME/etc/hobbitclient.cfg
               CMD $HOBBITCLIENTHOME/ext/hphwraid.sh
               LOGFILE $HOBBITCLIENTHOME/logs/hphwraid.log
               INTERVAL 20m  
 
	3/ Provide privileges at the hobbit user to run the hpacucli command using "sudo"
	    
	    root# visudo	
	        Add this at the end of the file 
		  hobbit ALL= NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/hpacucli
		
		and comment this : 
		  #Default requiretty


	4/ On server, edit your '${BBHOME}/etc/bb-hosts' and add the keyword 'hpraid' on host you want to monitor
            0.0.0.0  hostname_HP   # conn ssh hpraid    NAME:"My Server HP1" CLIENT:hostame_HP.my.domain
     
  	5/ Et voila; the 'HPRAID' column should appear under 5min.

Enjoy ;)
