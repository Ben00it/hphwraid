hphwraid is a simple and efficient Hobbit / XYmon extension to monitor hardware raid on HP ProLiant servers such as ProLiant DL, ML, or BL. It has been written in bash, tested on recent linux distro and could be setup in less then 3min.

This script auto detect the amount of RAID Controller on the machine and the amount of plugged hard drive. The Hobbit / XYmon RAID icon switch to RED is disk(s) is(are) down(aka hardware drive) or/and the RAID (aka logical drive) is rebuilding.
